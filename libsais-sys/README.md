# libsais-sys

This crate contains raw bindings to the [`libsais`](https://github.com/IlyaGrebnov/libsais) C library by Ilya Grebnov. It is highly recommended to use the API wrapper [crate](https://github.com/feldroop/libsais-rs) instead.

The existing `doxygen` documentation was turned into the `rustdoc` format using [doxygen-rs](https://github.com/Techie-Pi/doxygen-rs) and some custom tinkering.
